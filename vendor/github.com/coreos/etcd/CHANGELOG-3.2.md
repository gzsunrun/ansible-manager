## [v3.2.18](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.18) (TBD)

See [code changes](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/compare/v3.2.17...v3.2.18) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes.

### Improved

- Adjust [election timeout on server restart](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/9415) to reduce [disruptive rejoining servers](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/9333).
  - Previously, etcd fast-forwards election ticks on server start, with only one tick left for leader election. This is to speed up start phase, without having to wait until all election ticks elapse. Advancing election ticks is useful for cross datacenter deployments with larger election timeouts. However, it was affecting cluster availability if the last tick elapses before leader contacts the restarted node.
  - Now, when etcd restarts, it adjusts election ticks with more than one tick left, thus more time for leader to prevent disruptive restart.

### Metrics, Monitoring

- Add missing [`etcd_network_peer_sent_failures_total` count](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/9437).

### Go

- Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).


## [v3.2.17](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.17) (2018-03-08)

See [code changes](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/compare/v3.2.16...v3.2.17) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes.

### Fixed: v2

- Fix [v2 proxy leaky HTTP requests](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/9336).

### Fixed: v3

- Fix [server panic on invalid Election Proclaim/Resign HTTP(S) requests](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/9379).
  - Previously, wrong-formatted HTTP requests to Election API could trigger panic in etcd server.
  - e.g. `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3/election/proclaim -X POST -d '{"value":""}'`, `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3/election/resign -X POST -d '{"value":""}'`.
- Prevent [overflow by large `TTL` values for `Lease` `Grant`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/9399).
  - `TTL` parameter to `Grant` request is unit of second.
  - Leases with too large `TTL` values exceeding `math.MaxInt64` [expire in unexpected ways](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/9374).
  - Server now returns `rpctypes.ErrLeaseTTLTooLarge` to client, when the requested `TTL` is larger than *9,000,000,000 seconds* (which is >285 years).
  - Again, etcd `Lease` is meant for short-periodic keepalives or sessions, in the range of seconds or minutes. Not for hours or days!
- Enable etcd server [`raft.Config.CheckQuorum` when starting with `ForceNewCluster`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/9347).

### Go

- Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).


## [v3.2.16](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.16) (2018-02-12)

See [code changes](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/compare/v3.2.15...v3.2.16) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes.

### Fixed: v3

- Fix [`mvcc` "unsynced" watcher restore operation](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/9297).
  - "unsynced" watcher is watcher that needs to be in sync with events that have happened.
  - That is, "unsynced" watcher is the slow watcher that was requested on old revision.
  - "unsynced" watcher restore operation was not correctly populating its underlying watcher group.
  - Which possibly causes [missing events from "unsynced" watchers](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/9086).

### Go

- Compile with [*Go 1.8.5*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

- Return non-zero exit code on unhealthy `endpoint health`.

### Security, Authentication

See [security doc](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md) for more details.

- [Server supports reverse-lookup on wildcard DNS `SAN`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/8281). For instance, if peer cert contains only DNS names (no IP addresses) in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, server first reverse-lookups the remote IP address to get a list of names mapping to that address (e.g. `nslookup IPADDR`). Then accepts the connection if those names have a matching name with peer cert's DNS names (either by exact or wildcard match). If none is matched, server forward-lookups each DNS entry in peer cert (e.g. look up `example.default.svc` when the entry is `*.example.default.svc`), and accepts connection only when the host's resolved addresses have the matching IP address with the peer's remote IP address. For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["*.example.default.svc", "*.example.default.svc.cluster.local"]` when peer B's remote IP address is `10.138.0.2`. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A reverse-lookup the IP `10.138.0.2` to get the list of host names. And either exact or wildcard match the host names with peer B's cert DNS names in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field. If none of reverse/forward lookups worked, it returns an error `"tls: "10.138.0.2" does not match any of DNSNames ["*.example.default.svc","*.example.default.svc.cluster.local"]`. See [issue#8268](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/8268) for more detail.

### Metrics, Monitoring

### Go

- Compile with [*Go 1.8.3*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).


## [v3.2.2](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.2) (2017-07-07)

See [code changes](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/compare/v3.2.1...v3.2.2) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes.

### Improved

- Rate-limit lease revoke on expiration.
- Extend leases on promote to avoid queueing effect on lease expiration.

### Security, Authentication

See [security doc](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md) for more details.

- [Server accepts connections if IP matches, without checking DNS entries](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/8223). For instance, if peer cert contains IP addresses and DNS names in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, and the remote IP address matches one of those IP addresses, server just accepts connection without further checking the DNS names. For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["invalid.domain", "10.138.0.2"]` when peer B's remote IP address is `10.138.0.2` and `invalid.domain` is a invalid host. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A successfully authenticates B, since Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field has a valid matching IP address. See [issue#8206](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/8206) for more detail.

### Fixed: v3

- Accept connection with matched IP SAN but no DNS match.
  - Don't check DNS entries in certs if there's a matching IP.

### Fixed: gRPC gateway

- Use user-provided listen address to connect to gRPC gateway.
  - `net.Listener` rewrites IPv4 0.0.0.0 to IPv6 [::], breaking IPv6 disabled hosts.
  - Only v3.2.0, v3.2.1 are affected.

### Go

- Compile with [*Go 1.8.3*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).


## [v3.2.1](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.1) (2017-06-23)

### Improved

- Improve backend read concurrency.

### Breaking Changes

- Increased [`--snapshot-count` default value from 10,000 to 100,000](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/7160).
  - Higher snapshot count means it holds Raft entries in memory for longer before discarding old entries.
  - It is a trade-off between less frequent snapshotting and [higher memory usage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60589#issuecomment-371977156).
  - User lower `--snapshot-count` value for lower memory usage.
  - User higher `--snapshot-count` value for better availabilities of slow followers (less frequent snapshots from leader).
- `clientv3.Lease.TimeToLive` returns `LeaseTimeToLiveResponse.TTL == -1` on lease not found.
- `clientv3.NewFromConfigFile` is moved to `clientv3/yaml.NewConfig`.
- `embed.Etcd.Peers` field is now `[]*peerListener`.
- Rejects domains names for `--listen-peer-urls` and `--listen-client-urls` (3.1 only prints out warnings), since [domain name is invalid for network interface binding](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/6336).

### Dependency

- Upgrade [`google.golang.org/grpc`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases) from [**`v1.0.4`**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.0.4) to [**`v1.2.1`**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.2.1).
- Upgrade [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases) to [**`v1.2.0`**](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/tag/v1.2.0).

### Metrics, Monitoring

- Add `etcd_debugging_server_lease_expired_total` metrics.

### Security, Authentication

See [security doc](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md) for more details.

- [TLS certificates get reloaded on every client connection](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/7829). This is useful when replacing expiry certs without stopping etcd servers; it can be done by overwriting old certs with new ones. Refreshing certs for every connection should not have too much overhead, but can be improved in the future, with caching layer. Example tests can be found [here](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/b041ce5d514a4b4aaeefbffb008f0c7570a18986/integration/v3_grpc_test.go#L1601-L1757).
- [Server denies incoming peer certs with wrong IP `SAN`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/7687). For instance, if peer cert contains any IP addresses in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, server authenticates a peer only when the remote IP address matches one of those IP addresses. This is to prevent unauthorized endpoints from joining the cluster.  For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["*.example.default.svc", "*.example.default.svc.cluster.local", "10.138.0.27"]` when peer B's actual IP address is `10.138.0.2`, not `10.138.0.27`. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A will reject B with the error `x509: certificate is valid for 10.138.0.27, not 10.138.0.2`, because B's remote IP address does not match the one in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.
- [Server resolves TLS `DNSNames` when checking `SAN`](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/7767). For instance, if peer cert contains only DNS names (no IP addresses) in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, server authenticates a peer only when forward-lookups (`dig b.com`) on those DNS names have matching IP with the remote IP address.  For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["b.com"]` when peer B's remote IP address is `10.138.0.2`. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A looks up the incoming host `b.com` to get the list of IP addresses (e.g. `dig b.com`). And rejects B if the list does not contain the IP `10.138.0.2`, with the error `tls: 10.138.0.2 does not match any of DNSNames ["b.com"]`.
- Auth support JWT token.

### Added

- RPCs
  - Add Election, Lock service.
- Native client etcdserver/api/v3client
  - client "embedded" in the server.
- Logging, monitoring
  - Server warns large snapshot operations.

### Added: `etcd`

- Add `--enable-v2` flag to enable v2 API server.
  - `--enable-v2=true` by default.
- Add `--auth-token` flag.
- v3.2 compactor runs [every hour](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/7875).
  - Compactor only supports periodic compaction.
  - Compactor continues to record latest revisions every 5-minute.
  - For every hour, it uses the last revision that was fetched before compaction period, from the revision records that were collected every 5-minute.
  - That is, for every hour, compactor discards historical data created before compaction period.
  - The retention window of compaction period moves to next hour.
  - For instance, when hourly writes are about 100 and `--auto-compaction-retention=10`, v3.1 compacts revision 1000, 2000, and 3000 for every 10-hour, while v3.2 compacts revision 1000, 1100, and 1200 for every 1-hour.
  - If compaction succeeds or requested revision has already been compacted, it resets period timer and removes used compacted revision from historical revision records (e.g. start next revision collect and compaction from previously collected revisions).
  - If compaction fails, it retries in 5 minutes.

### Added: `clientv3`

- STM prefetching.
- Add namespace feature.
- Add `ErrOldCluster` with server version checking.
- Translate `WithPrefix()` into `WithFromKey()` for empty key.

### Added: v3 `etcdctl`

- Add `check perf` command.
- Add `--from-key` flag to role grant-permission command.
- `lock` command takes an optional command to execute.

### Fixed: v2

- Allow snapshot over 512MB.

### Added: `grpc-proxy`

- Proxy endpoint discovery.
- Namespaces.
- Coalesce lease requests.

### Added: `gateway`

- Support [DNS SRV priority](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/7882) for [smart proxy routing](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/4378).
